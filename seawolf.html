  <h1>SEAWOLF Submarine Simulator</h1>
  <div>
    <h2>Scenarios:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="three_oilers.html">Three Oilers</a>: sink a convoy of three oil tankers....
        <br/>
        1. Detect three oil tankers with your sonar (you will need to change your heading and depth).<br/>
        2. If you can not find them then simply go to the periscope depth (PERISCOPE button).<br />
        3. Once you see where they are, load your tubes with torpedos, flood them, choose target and FIRE!<br />
      </li>
      <li><a href="akula_is_out_there.html">Aku&#x142;a is out there!</a> (this does not work so don't try it yet....)</li>
      <li><a href="alpha_is_out_there.html">Alpha is out there!</a> (this scenario does not even exist yet....)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Quick Manual:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Left-click selects a target, Right-click changes your course.</li>
      <li>Arrow keys change the position of control panels. Use SHIFT/ALT keys with arrow keys to select which panel you wish to move.</li>
      <li>
        The information panel shows the current speed, bearing and depth of your vessel (and your target if selected).
        It also shows you the depths of all thermal layers.
      </li>
      <li>The are two more panels: one for controlling your ship, another for controlling your torpedo tubes and inventory.</td>
      <li>Use the STOP/SLOW/..../FLANK buttons to adjust the speed of your submarine.</li>
      <li>Use the &#xd7;1 &#xd7;2 &#xd7;4 &#xd7;8 buttons to adjust the speed of simulation.</li>
      <li>Use the UP THERMAL / DOWN THERMAL buttons to change your depth.
        Ocean is divided into layers of water of different temperaturs, which attenuate propagation of sound waves.
        Hence you may wish to dive below certain thermal layers to hide from enemy's sonar.
      </li>
      <li>You can send a loud PING impulse from your sonar, so you can detect other vessels easier.
        Be careful! Ping also makes you audible to enemy's sonar.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can deploy towed sonar array for better detection of enemy vessels.
        This towed array slows down your submarine, so you may wish to retrieve it as soon as you know where your targets are located.
        If you are in trouble and have no time for retrieving then simply cut it! (but you will no longer be able to use it later)
      </li>
      <li>To launch torpedos you need to first load them into your tubes, flood them, select a target and fire when they are armed.
        Torpedo is attached to your submarine by a cable, so you have some control over it
        (i.e. detonate, search other submarines or surface vessels, change depth or go to a waypoint).
        Once the torpedo reaches the end of cable you loose control overit.
        Be careful! It may actually detect your ship and get back on you!
      </li>
      <li>
        Enjoy....
