<h1>What is known about the character of noise created by submarines?
<p>Appendix 1</p></h1>
<a href="https://fas.org/spp/eprint/snf0322.htm">E.V. Miasnikov, <em>The Future of Russia's Strategic Nuclear Forces: Discussions
and Arguments,</em> </a>
<p>A moving submarine<sup></sup><a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a> is source of noise by whose characteristics it is possible not
only to detect it against the background of the ocean's natural noises, but also
reveal its location, speed and, generally speaking, identify it. Several mechanisms
for noise radiation from the submarine exist, which are more or less prevalent
depending on the frequency band, speed and depth of the submarine. Among these
mechanisms are hull vibration, power plant equipment, propellers and flow noise
(hydrodynamic noise).
</p><p>The submarine's noise level or source level (SL) is the intensity of sound in a given
frequency band at a distance of one 1 meter from the submarine within a receiver's
direction.<sup></sup><a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a>
</p><p> In practice, SL is measured in logarithmic units or decibels (dB) in
relation to a standard intensity. The Russian Navy generally takes the standard to
be the threshold for audibility (a plane sound wave of an intensity 20 Pa). In the
American Navy SL is defined at a distance of 1 yard (1 yard = 0.914 m) relative to the
source intensity of 1 Pa. The quantitative significance of SL, defined by the Russian
and American systems in one or the other frequency bands, will differ by 27 dB.
</p><p>As a rule, the following regularities in the behavior of the noise spectrum of
submarines are observed.
</p><p>The SL frequency of the spectrum constitutes a mixture of the continuous and
discrete ("linear-frequency") spectrum. The continuous part of SL spectrum is
characterized by a maximum in the area of 50-100 Hz. At frequencies greater than
200 Hz SL falls by 6 dB when the frequency is doubled. This means that SL is
inversely proportional to the square of the frequency.
</p><p>The discrete components are the most visible signs of the submarines' SL spectrum
since they are detected even at low speeds, when submarines produce minimal noise.
Moreover, the aggregate of the discrete components of the noise spectrum (the so
called "acoustic portrait") which is unique for each submarine, may be used to
identify the source.
</p><p>Discrete lines in the 0.1-10 Hz band are caused by rotation of the propellers. This
noise is difficult to suppress. Moreover, the noise from the propeller may be heard in
the ocean at a distance of up to several thousand kilometers since absorption by
ocean waters at this low frequency is negligible. The method of narrow-band
filtration of the spectrum's discrete line at frequencies up to several Hz is the basic
working principle for sonar systems for long-distance detection.
</p><p>Discrete lines in the frequency band of several Hz to several hundred Hertz is
associated with vibrations from the submarine's hull and power plant equipment. The
most characteristic line in the SL spectrum is the peak at frequencies of 50 and 60 Hz
for Russian and American submarines respectively, i.e., the lines which correspond to
the basic frequencies of the submarines electric generators. The SL spectrum of first
generation SSNs contained discrete lines at frequencies, which are multiples of 50
and 60 Hz, or in other words, harmonics of the basic frequencies. Specialists claim to
have successfully registered up to 5 harmonics of basic frequencies. The spectrums
of modern fourth generation submarines, those built at the end of the 1980's, do not
contain discrete lines at frequencies greater than 100 Hz. This is justified to a lesser
degree when the speed is less than 8 knots [Gorbachev, 1994].
</p><p><strong>Table A1. A model of a SL spectrum of submarines</strong>
<table cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3" border="1">
<tbody><tr><th></th><th>SL component of the spectrum<br>[relative to 1 Pa at 1 m]</th><th>Spectral strength of <br>SL in a frequency band (1Hz) <br>[relative to 1 Pa at 1m]</th></tr>

<tr><th>"Quiet" Submarine</th><td>120</td><td>100</td></tr>
<tr><th>"Very quiet" Submarine</th><td>100</td><td> 80</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</p><p>These peculiarities of a submarine's SL spectrum make it possible to describe them by
two parameters, namely, SL at a frequency of 1 kHz and the energy of the most
powerful discrete components in the frequency band of 5-200 Hz. Table A1 shows a
model of a submarine's SL using these parameters.<sup></sup><a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a>
</p><p>Commenting on Table A1, we stress that the estimates which were put forth relate to
movement at small submerged speeds of nearly 4 knots (2 m/s) with the limited use of
the working mechanisms (the so called "ultraquiet operation" mode). In this mode the
basic sources for noise are the submarine's propellers and the power plant equipment.
</p><p>The "ultraquiet " mode is used by submarines only as needed. The submarine's speed on
combat patrols generally does not exceed the so called "maximum low noise" speed
which amounts to nearly 8 knots (4 m/s). The source level at this speed may exceed SL
at a "quiet" mode by 5-10 dB (see Figure A1)
</p><p>Often, to complete their assigned missions, submarines have to carry out long
distance voyages. Russian and American SSNs travel distances of several thousand
miles to patrol zones. In order to increase their operational efficiency,<sup></sup><a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a> submarines
in transit move at a maximum speed which guarantees the submarine covertness.
Generally this speed does not exceed 15 knots (7.5 m/s). At this speed the flow noise
(so-called hydrodynamic noise) predominates. The flow noise strongly depends on
the submarine's speed, and generally the SL is proportional to the speed raised to the
sixth power. This means that doubling the speed will increase SL by 18 dB. It has been
suggested that a submarine in transit is 15-20 dB noisier than one in the "quiet" mode.
</p><p>It is also necessary to note that the noise level of a specific submarine doesn't remain
constant. During their service life, submarines wear out and their mechanisms
become unbalanced. It is the opinion of specialists that during its operational life,
the noise level of submarines grows on average by 5 dB.
</p><p>Although the program for building submarines was, after the second world war,
given priority in both the US and the USSR, the American shipbuilders essentially
left the Russians behind on the issue of ensuring the covertness of submarines.
During the 1960's subjective factors caused the lag. The Russian Navy was more
interested in high speed submarines than in covert ones. [Parkhomenko, 1993].
</p><p>The second generation of Soviet submarines was less noisy, but progress in decreasing
the SSBN signature was achieved by the Soviet shipbuilding industry only during the
1980's with the appearance of the strategic submarine design 667 BDRM. During this
period new technologies were introduced which resulted in an order of magnitude
improvement in the accuracy of manufacturing gears for the main turbine gear
assembly, shafts and propellers. A significant decrease in noise level was also
achieved with the application of active noise suppression methods for submarines.
</p><p>The main reason was that Russia lagged behind the US in manufacturing
technologies. In particular, according to specialists' testimony, improving the
tolerance for the size of a tooth gear on the submarine's main turbine gear assembly
(GTZA) by 0.1 to 0.01 mm permitted a reduction of the submarine's SL by 3-4 orders of
magnitude (30-40 dB).
</p><p>Nevertheless, there existed objective causes which, in principal, limited the
possibilities for domestic shipbuilding. As opposed to American SSBNs, Russian SSBNs
are double-hulled, with double reactors and double shafts. This design guarantees
great reliability, but, inevitably, at a sacrifice to the submarine's covertness.
[Parkhomenko, 1993]. Russia's sea-based ballistic missiles differ from American
missiles by their greater dimensions and correspondingly larger weight. As a result,
the displacement of domestic strategic submarines became larger despite a smaller
number of missiles being accommodated.<sup></sup><a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>
</p><p>Quantitative data on the actual noise levels of combat submarines is highly
classified. However, an analysis of the available unclassified technical literature
permits us to estimate their noise level.
</p><p>In particular, information on the noise level of diesel submarines during the Second
World War has been published. [Urick, 1983]. This generation of submarines may be
referred to as "noisy" since at low frequencies, SL exceeded 125-145 dB at speeds of 4-10 knots (2-5 m/s).
</p><p>Some estimates of the noise level of diesel-electric submarines 
from the 1960's-1980's
were also made by participants of the Russian-American conference on 
anti-submarine warfare in coastal waters (see Figure A1.2). Although the
 regimes, from
which these noise characteristics were taken are not, as a rule, 
specified by the
authors, nevertheless it may be proposed that the data is related to 
submarines (PL)
working in "ultraquiet" modes. In particular, according to the supplied 
estimates, SL
of the diesel 887 design (Kilo) submarine conforms with "quiet" 
submarines.
</p><p>Figure A1.3 shows the noise spectrum for a diesel submarine from one of the designs
developed during the 1980's by the German company IKL. This chart corresponds well
to the assumptions made in this article on the character of the noise spectrum and on
the dependence of source levels on the submarine's speed. It is easy to see that with
speeds corresponding to 2 and 5 knots (1 and 2.5 m/s), the SL of a diesel submarine is
also located within the "quiet" submarine range.
</p><p>Information on the noise level of nuclear submarines is practically non-existent in
the open literature. However, specialists have repeatedly said that the noise level
of a nuclear submarine is higher than that of a diesel submarine running on
batteries.<sup></sup><a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a>
</p><p> This fact may be explained by several reasons. First, like a diesel
submarine, a nuclear submarine may work at a minimal speed, running off the storage
cells (batteries). However, the submarine's nuclear reactor continues working and
this is an additional source of noise. Second, the displacement for nuclear
submarines usually exceeds, by several times, the displacement of diesel, and this
requires a greater power to weight ratio. In our calculations we made the
assumption that within a "quiet" mode the difference in noise level between strategic
nuclear submarines and diesel submarines, which were developed at the same time, is
10 dB.
</p><p>There is still one assumption that we made which was associated with the source
level at discrete frequencies and at a frequency of 1kHz within a given noise
spectrum for a submarine. As shown by the analysis of SL of diesel submarines, the
energy of the most powerful discrete components of the spectrum exceeds the energy
in the 1Hz band at a frequency of 1 kHz by nearly 20 dB. This is probably the pattern
followed by noise spectrums of nuclear submarines.
</p><p>Table A2 shows estimates of SL of domestic strategic submarines. These estimates
were published for the first time by the author of the present work in the article "On
the covertness of Russian submarine cruisers" (<em>Military Journal, Bulletin Postfactum</em>,
#21, 1994, p.6-9). [Also published as "Russia's Strategic Ballistic Missile Submarines:
Security from Detection," <em>Military Journal, Postfactum analytical Series, </em>N 21, 1994, p.
5-7] The data in the present table differs somewhat from that previously published.
We suggest that the noise level of first and second generation SSNs were somewhat
too high.
</p><p>The noise levels of first generation Soviet missile submarines (designs AV-611, 629),
evidently, were of the same magnitude as submarines from the Second World War.<sup></sup><a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a>
</p><p>
The diameter of the propellers of these submarines were relatively small, so even at
low speeds the submarines worked in a noisy cavitation mode. It is also well known
that submarines with first generation ballistic missiles were not specially developed
for accommodating these missiles.
</p><p>Missile submarines were actually torpedo submarines with missile compartments "cut
into them." Decreasing the noisiness of submarines was not at that time the basic
criteria when planning submarines. Incidentally we note that our estimate of 5-10 dB
exceeds the SL of the 641 design submarine (see figure A1.2) which was developed at
the end of the 1950's.
</p><p>The 658 missile SSBN (Hotel) was developed practically in parallel with the 629
submarine (Golf). There was very little experience in operating nuclear power
plants. The lead submarine of this series of 658s joined the service at the end of 1960 -
two years after the first Soviet SSN "K-3" had been tested. Therefore, the difference
in SL of 10 dB compared to the 629 design missile submarine seems sufficiently
"reasonable."

</tbody></table>
</p><p>We assume that, as a rule, the noise levels of each newly designed SSBN decreases by
5 dB in comparison with the previous. Nevertheless, certain exceptions were made. It
is probable that the SL of the 667 B (Delta) strategic missile carrier and the 667 BD
(Delta II) were comparable. This is in spite of the fact that the 667 BD (Delta II)
nuclear submarine was developed 3 years later and it had a larger displacement.
</p><p>There were also differences in the size of the displacement and power to weight ratio
of the 667 BDR (Delta II) and 941 (Typhoon) strategic missile submarines. Although in
the open literature it is noted that after entering into the Navy's service the heavy
SSBNs 941 design (Typhoon) was the quietest strategic submarine [Kostev, 1994], we
suggest that its SL coincided with the lower noise boundaries of the strategic SSBN
design 667 BDR (Delta III).
</p><p>We notice that our estimates of SL for the 941 (Typhoon) and the 667 BDRM (Delta
IV) missile submarines are 8-13 dB higher than the diesel-electric 877 (Kilo) submarine
which was developed at the same time.
</p><p>Table A2 shows for comparison SL estimates, made by specialists, of the SSN 971
(classified by the Russian Navy as "Bars" and by NATO as "Akula") which is currently
in production. In the West it is believed that these submarine significantly surpass the
covertness not only of previous generation Russian SSNs, but also modern American
SSNs [Gertz, 1995]. Probably, if a new generation of Russian strategic missile
submarines will be built, they will not be much noisier than the SSN "Bars".

In our previous paper, we used somewhat different set of parameters to describe the SL models of
"noisy", "quiet" and "very quiet" submarines [Miasnikov, 1993]. The most powerful (containing maximum energy)
tonals at frequencies close to 30 and 300 Hz respectively were chosen in submarine generated noise spectra. The
SL, which corresponds to 30 Hz in the "old" set of parameters coincides with the data in the second column (5-200
Hz) of the Table A1. The other parameter (SL level for 300 Hz) is actually 10 dB lower than the data in the same
column.

Here "operational efficiency" is defined as the fraction of time spent by a submarine, while on patrol in a
certain area with respect to the whole cycle, which includes transit both ways, overhauls and submarine crew
preparation between patrol missions.

SSBNs of 941 project ("Typhoon") are well known to be the largest submarines in the world. They have
1.5 times greater displacement than the US "Ohio" SSBNs. Each R-39 missile on the Russian SSBN weighs 90 t. In
comparison, the weight of the US "Trident-II" missile is 57 t <em>[Combat Fleets, 1995].</em>

AV-611 project submarines represented a modernization of 611 project , 
which was developed in 1943-49. Missile submarines of 629 project were
